    <p>Pentique is an online shop based in Durbanville, Western Cape, South Africa.</p>
    <p>We believe: "<b>A Sticker a Day adds Fun to Schoolwork and Play.</b>"</p>
    <p>
      Stickers can be used in creative projects, as finger puppets in story telling and in
      educational activities, to name but a few. Let your imagination go wild and use our stickers
      to make craft projects, stories, etcetera, come alive!
    </p>

    <p>
      We have our own range of fun and reward/motivational stickers. We regularly bring out new
      designs, but we keep our tried and trusted ones. Our own ranges are locally made.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our purpose is to provide motivational stickers that will reward good effort, progress,
      outstanding work, etcetera. Our goal is also to provide educators and parents with a tool they
      can use to inspire and motivate learners to work harder, put in more effort and produce the
      best work they are capable of. The ultimate goal is to get learners to put in the effort
      required to reach their dreams. A good education opens doors and at Pentique, we want to do
      our bit to push doors open a little wider for the youth.
